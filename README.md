# Gober's Tinkerpad
My Hackpad submission!

# About
This is my first hardware project, and it took me WEEKS to finish because I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I had to restart so many times I almost gave up, but here we are!
# Schematic
I got a bit of help from my friend setting up the schematic. I wanted a LOT of buttons, and I had no idea how to make a matrix. it all worked out (hopefully!)

# PCB
The PCB is sort of crowded since I designed a case for my first attempt and had to restart multiple times. I didn't want to redo the case.

# CAD
Here is the case for the macropad. Yes, I know the model looks ugly.

# Firmware
I haven't started the firmware yet, but I will use QMK or kmk depending on if my computer supports virtualization or not.

# BOM
Materials I used:
- 16x Cherry MX switches
- 1x 0.91 inch OLED display
- 1x Xiao RP2040
- 16x 1N4148 Diodes
- 1x 3D printed case
