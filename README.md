# Gober's Tinkerpad
My Hackpad submission!

# Purpose
I designed this macropad to make my life easier. I do digital art and I want to keep the tablet pen in my hand while putting in keyboard shortcuts, but I push my keyboard against my computer to make room for my drawing tablet, making my wrist uncomfortable. The controls on my drawing tablet were HORRIBLE, and its driver made my computer lag. (hooray for intel celeron!)
I didn't just make this macropad for drawing, it'll have many other uses soon.
# Schematic

I know, this looks very weird, but it was my first time EVER touching KiCad and I didn't know how to put all those switches together and stay organized. (this says a lot about me, I know)
